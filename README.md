### 🌱 About Me

I’m a learner of the **ALX Front-End Developer Program**, passionate about creating clean, accessible, and user-friendly web solutions that solve real problems. My journey into software engineering started with curiosity — I wanted to understand how websites come alive through code and how they can connect, educate, and inspire people.

I’m driven by a desire to help others through technology. Whether it’s designing a form that collects valuable feedback or a simple page that makes information easier to access, I believe every project should make a difference.
